# G2DT - Patternerenrettap
Patternerrenrettap is an app still in development stages within the [G2DT](https://trpquo.github.io/) project. It is going to be built in order to experiment with different symmetries and abilities of Processing 3 framework to construct and draw patterns. It will also experiment with designing a GUI for pattern design.

Idea for this project started long time ago, and it's first step was creating a small JavaScript ([_jCanvas.js_](https://projects.calebevans.me/jcanvas/)) app that constructs, according to Matila Ghyka's [Geometry of Art and Life](http://store.doverpublications.com/0486235424.html), all possible regular grid patterns on which symmetric patterns could be build: [Patternerenrettap](https://trpquo.github.io/Patternerenrettap) - a web grid pattern creator.
